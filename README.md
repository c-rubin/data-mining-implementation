<h1> Machine Learning Implementation CEN 376 - Data Mining<br/>2022 - 2023 Fall Semester</h1><br/><br/>



<h2> Description </h2>
In this implementation, we will be classifying credit cards from creditcard.csv.

We will first initialize our program, by loading the data into a dataframe (using Pandas) and split the data into training and testing sets.

We will then train classifiers using six different techniques: Random Forest Classifier, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Ada Boost Classifier, Linear Discriminant Analysis Classifier and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis Classifier.

We will also print the confusion matrix, classification report and accoracy score for each classification that we've made.</br>

This project has been implemented in Python.<br/>
